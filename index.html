                Hi Swathi,<br>
                <br>
    
                I hope this message finds you well. I've been reflecting on our recent interactions, and I realize that I made a mistake by talking trash to you. I want to sincerely apologize for my words and the hurt they may have caused.
    
                I value our friendship a lot, and it was wrong of me to express myself in such a negative way. I understand the importance of treating each other with respect, and I'm truly sorry for not upholding that standard in our conversation.
    
                I take full responsibility for my words, and I want you to know that I'm committed to making amends. If there's anything specific I said that hurt you, please let me know so I can address it directly and learn from this experience.
    
                I understand that actions speak louder than words, and I'm dedicated to showing you through my future behavior that I've learned from this mistake.
    
                <br><br>Thank you for taking the time to read my message, and I hope we can talk soon.
            </p>
